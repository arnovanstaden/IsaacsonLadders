                <h2>User and Safe Working Requirements for all Isaacson Ladders</h2>
                <p>The following information conforms to SANS 50131-3:2017 (EN 131-3:2017).</p>
                <h3>General requirements:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>when collecting a ladder at Isaacson Ladders, and it is transported on roof bars or within a
                        truck
                        or
                        other type of vehicle, ensure that all the ladders are secured and suitably placed to prevent
                        damage;</li>
                    <li>when collecting or receiving an Isaacson Ladder, ensure that it is not damaged in any way, and
                        confirm
                        its
                        condition and the operation of all moving parts. If damaged please return in line with the
                        return
                        policy;</li>
                    <li>for professional users, conduct a risk assessment before using a ladder, respecting the
                        legislation
                        in
                        the
                        country of use;</li>
                    <li>for non-professional users, before a task is performed ensure that the technical specifications
                        of
                        the
                        ladder is in line with the task to be performed and that all safety instructions as they appear
                        on
                        the
                        ladder are
                        adhered to;</li>
                    <li>always have an assistant available when using a ladder.
                </ul>

                <h3>Before each use of a ladder the user must:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>be medically fit to use a ladder. Certain medical conditions or medication, alcohol or drug
                        abuse
                        could make ladder use unsafe;</li>
                    <li>visually check / inspect that the ladder is not damaged from previous use and that it is safe to
                        use
                        at the start of each working day;</li>
                    <li>ensure the ladder is suitable for the task to be performed;</li>
                    <li>remove any contamination from the ladder, such as wet paint, mud, or oil that may have
                        accumulated
                        from previous use.
                </ul>

                <h3>Positioning and erecting of a ladder</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>ladder shall be erected at the correct position, such as the correct angle for a leaning ladder
                        (angle
                        of inclination approximately 1:4) with the rungs, steps or treads level and ladder completely
                        opened;</li>
                    <li>locking devices, if fitted, must be fully secured before use;</li>
                    <li>ladder must be on an even, level and unmoveable base;</li>
                    <li>leaning ladder should lean against a flat non-fragile surface and should be secured before use,
                        e.g.
                        tied or use of a suitable stability device;</li>
                    <li>ladder shall never be repositioned from above;</li>
                    <li>when positioning the ladder consider the risk of collision with the ladder e.g. from
                        pedestrians,
                        vehicles or doors. Secure doors (not fire exists) and windows where possible in the work area;
                    </li>
                    <li>identify any electrical risks in the work area, such as overhead lines or other exposed
                        electrical
                        equipment;</li>
                    <li>extension ladders must be positioned on a flat surface area;</li>
                    <li>ladder shall be positioned on its feet, not on the rungs or steps;</li>
                    <li>ladders shall not be positioned on slippery surfaces (such as ice / frost, shiny surfaces or
                        significantly contaminated solid surfaces) unless additional effective measures are taken to
                        prevent
                        the
                        ladder slipping or ensuring contaminated surfaces are sufficiently clean.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Using the ladder</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>do not exceed the maximum total load for the type of ladder;</li>
                    <li>do not overreach; where applicable the user should keep their belt buckle (navel) inside the
                        stiles
                        and both feet on the same step/rung throughout the task;</li>
                    <li>do not step off a leaning ladder at a higher level without additional security, such as tying
                        off or
                        use of a suitable stability device;</li>
                    <li>do not use standing ladders for access to another level;</li>
                    <li>do not stand on the top three steps/rungs of a leaning ladder;</li>
                    <li>do not stand on the top two steps/rungs of a standing ladder without a platform and hand/knee
                        rail;
                    </li>
                    <li>do not stand on the top four steps/rungs of a standing ladder with an extending ladder at the
                        top;
                    </li>
                    <li>ladders should only be used for light work of short duration;</li>
                    <li>use non-conductive ladders for unavoidable live electrical work;</li>
                    <li>do not use the ladder outside in adverse weather conditions, such as strong wind;</li>
                    <li>take precautions against children playing on the ladder;</li>
                    <li>secure doors (not fire exits) and windows where possible in the work area;</li>
                    <li>face the ladder when ascending and descending;</li>
                    <li>keep a secure grip on the ladder when ascending and descending;</li>
                    <li>do not use the ladder as a bridge;</li>
                    <li>wear suitable footwear when climbing a ladder;</li>
                    <li>avoid excessive side loadings e.g. drilling brick and concrete;</li>
                    <li>do not spend long periods on a ladder without regular breaks (tiredness is a risk);</li>
                    <li>leaning ladders used for access to a higher level should be extended at least 1 m above the
                        landing
                        point;</li>
                    <li>equipment carried while using a ladder should be light and easy to handle;</li>
                    <li>avoid work that imposes a sideways load on standing ladders, such as side-on drilling through
                        solid
                        materials (e.g. brick or concrete);</li>
                    <li>maintain a handhold whilst working from a ladder or take additional safety precautions if you
                        cannot.
                </ul>

                <h3>Repair, maintenance and storage</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Repairs and maintenance of returned items will be carried out by a competent staff member at
                        Isaacson
                        Ladders</li>
